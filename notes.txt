tommylincoln.net -- Notes

This is the project that involves designing my own website. I already have the
domain tommylincoln.net, with hostgator, which seems to have some pretty cool
features. The site has been sitting there for like over a year and has nothing
more than a simple "Hello, world!"-type statement.

To start with, I can fill this site with my ideas, my story, my day-to-day,
pictures of me, Nikita, my computer stuff... links to my github and
bitbucket sites, facebook, d-land, myspace; talk about what I like; what
I'm working on; be able to download my resume and discuss the kinds of work
I'm into and what I'm looking for.

I can also play with some scripting, databases, etc. Maybe create user
accounts, ...)
